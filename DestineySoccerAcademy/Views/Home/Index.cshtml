                            Matches are an essential part of sports. They give rise to competitive spirit and sportsmanship. Moreover, matches are a kind of get-together where players, apart from playing and displaying their physical stamina, exchange
                            ideas and information and have free and frank discussions among themselves. All our matches will stream online and uploaded on our yotube channel
                        </p>

                            We have developed an adaptable playing style for all players, to take into account the range of experience and skill. Our playing formation is based on a 4 – 2 – 3 – 1 system of play (which is adaptable to include 4 – 3 – 3,
                            4 – 5 – 1 and 4 – 4 – 2). This system promotes confidence on the ball and in a team situation. We aim to rotate playing positions to make the experience as wide as possible, and to create adaptable players. Players may
                            be played in a number of positions during their time at IHM to facilitate fixtures and for the IHM coaches to assess their best playing positions. Our aim is to develop players in a supportive and safe environment, and
                            to encourage them to reach their full potential. We also want our students to enjoy their course with us, while working hard to continue their personal development.
